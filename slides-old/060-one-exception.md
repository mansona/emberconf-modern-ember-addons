  There is one problem hidden in what I’ve just said though. if you addon is in the “do stuff” category then you cant have it automatically hook into any build process any more. You can tell the developer consuming your addon how to get it to hook in, but it can’t do this automatically any more. I’ve had a few discussion with Ed about this and there is a potential way forward. Hopefully I’m back here next year telling you about “build addons”, not least because my whole Empress project desperately needs them!

  Anyway let’s get back to what a V2 addon can do, and stop talking about what it can’t.
